      <h1>Hello welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        Your space for everything that has to do with color We have set
        ourselves the task to create one place where you can find matching
        colors, generate nice color palettes and learn more about color
        conversions and meaning. Sometimes it is hard to find inspiration for a
        good color scheme or you do not have the time to experiment until you
        find matching colors. To facilitate this process, we investigated this
        set of tools and want to share it with you. Feel free to use the color
        palettes or gradients in your project. If you want, you can recommend
        our site or refer it to your friends and workmates. We are always happy
        to hear from you. Our collection of tools has just been released and is
        currently in beta. At the moment, you can generate color palettes or
        create nice CSS gradients from colors of your choice. A whole new set of
        different tools is currently in work. There will also be an App for
        Android. If you want to stay up to date, have any questions, or even
        suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us!
